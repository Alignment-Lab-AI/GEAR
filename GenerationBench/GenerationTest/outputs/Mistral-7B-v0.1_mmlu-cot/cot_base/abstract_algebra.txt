Then $aH$ is a coset of $H$ in $G$. Since $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, $aH$ is a subgroup of $G$. Since $H$ is a non-abelian group, $aH$ is a non-abelian group. The answer is (C).

Q: Statement 1 | A ring homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel is {0}. Statement 2 | Q is an ideal in R.
(A) True, True (B) False, False (C) True, False (D) False, True 
A: Let's think step by step.
A_model:
Statement 1 is true. Let $f:R ightarrow S$ be a ring homomorphism. If $f$ is one to one, then $f(a) = f(b)$ implies that $a = b$. Hence $a - b \in ker(f)$. Since $f$ is one to one, $a - b = 0$ and $ker(f) = {0}$. Conversely, if $ker(f) = {0}$, then $f(a) = f(b)$ implies that $a - b \in ker(f)$. Since $ker(f) = {0}$, $a - b = 0$ and $a = b$. Hence $f$ is one to one. Statement 2 is false. Let $R = Z$ and $Q = 2Z$. Then $Q$ is an ideal in $R$ but $Q$ is not the kernel of any ring homomorphism. The answer is (C).

If $P$ is normal, then $P$ is the only Sylow p-subgroup of G. If $P$ is not normal, then there is another Sylow p-subgroup $Q$ of G. Since $P$ and $Q$ are Sylow p-subgroups, they are conjugate. Hence $P = gQg^{-1}$ for some $g\in G$. Since $P$ is normal, $gQg^{-1} = Q$. Hence $P = Q$ and $P$ is the only Sylow p-subgroup of G. The answer is (D).
