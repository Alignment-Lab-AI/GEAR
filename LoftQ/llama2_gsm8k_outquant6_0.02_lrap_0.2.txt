So, if Joey loses 1/7 of his body weight per week, Sandy will lose 1/7 x 4 = 1/4 of her body weight per week.\nNow, to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to divide the weight Sandy wants to lose by the weight she loses per week:\n1/4 x 12 weeks = 3 weeks\nTherefore, it will take Sandy 3 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.", 'Step 1: Calculate the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream at the old price:\n2 tubs of ice cream = $13 x 2 = $26\nStep 2: Calculate the cost of 4 packets of milk at the old price:\n4 packets of milk = $5 x 4 = $20\nStep 3: Calculate the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the new price:\n2 tubs of ice cream = $11 x 2 = $22\n4 packets of milk = $10 x 4 = $40\nStep 4: Calculate the total cost of buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the new price:\n$22 + $40 = $62\nSo, you will save $62 - $26 = $36 if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the new price.', 'Step 1: Identify the pattern in the serum’s effect\nThe serum causes a person to grow an extra arm every 3 days and an extra leg every 5 days.\nStep 2: Determine the total number of limbs the person will grow\nThe person will grow a total of 3 arms and 5 legs in 15 days.\nStep 3: Calculate the number of new limbs the person will grow each day\nTo calculate the number of new limbs the person will grow each day, divide the total number of limbs by the number of days the person has to grow them.

Add the total number of milliliters needed for all the laps:\n\n1200 ml + 1200 ml (since each lap is 0.25 km) = 2400 ml\n\nTherefore, Hannah needs to drink 2400 milliliters of water for running 8 laps.', "Step 1: Julie had $500 and spent 20% of it on clothes.\n20% of $500 = $100\nSo Julie spent $100 on clothes.\nStep 2: Julie had $400 left after spending $100 on clothes.\nThen she spent 25% of the remaining money on CDs.\n25% of $400 = $100\nSo Julie spent $100 on CDs.\nStep 3: Now, let's find out how much money Julie had left.\n$400 - $100 (on clothes) - $100 (on CDs) = $200\nSo Julie had $200 left.\nTherefore, the answer is $200.", "Let's assume the cost of the lot is x.\nSince the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.\nSo, the total cost of the house and the lot together is $120,000.\nSolving for x, we get:\n3x = 120,000\nx = 40,000\n\nTherefore, the cost of the house is 3x = 120,000 - 40,000 = 80,000.", 'Step 1: Calculate the cost price of each bag.\nCost price = $4 x 8 = $32\n\nStep 2: Calculate the selling price of each bag.\nSelling price = $8 x 8 = $64\n\nStep 3: Calculate the profit earned on each bag.\nProfit = Selling price - Cost price\nProfit = $64 - $32 = $32\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total profit earned on all bags.\nTotal profit = Profit x Number of bags sold\nTotal profit = $32 x 8 = $256\n\nTherefore, Tara earned a profit of $256 on her 40 bags.', '\nStep 1: Calculate the total time of the fight\n5 rounds x 3 minutes per round = 15 minutes\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of minutes Joe throws punches\n25 punches per minute x 15 minutes = 375 punches\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total number of punches Joe throws in the fight\n375 punches x 5 rounds = 1875 punches\n\nTherefore, Joe throws 1875 punches in the fight.', 'Step 1: Write down the given information:\nKelsie made 2 times more cookies than Josh.\nJosh made 1/4 the number of cookies that Suzanne made.\nSuzanne made 36 cookies.\nStep 2: Solve the first problem:\nKelsie made 2 times more cookies than Josh.
