["Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs Janet sells at the farmers' market daily.\nJanet sells the remaining eggs after she eats 3 for breakfast and bakes muffins for her friends. So, the number of eggs she sells daily = Total eggs per day - Number of eggs used for breakfast and muffins.\nTotal eggs per day = 16 eggs/day\nNumber of eggs used for breakfast and muffins = 3 eggs/day (as she eats 3 eggs every morning)\nNumber of eggs sold at the farmers' market daily = Total eggs per day - Number of eggs used for breakfast and muffins\n= 16 eggs/day - 3 eggs/day\n= 13 eggs/day\nSo, Janet sells 13 eggs at the farmers' market daily.\nStep 2: Calculate the total amount of money Janet makes daily at the farmers' market.\nThe price of each fresh duck egg = $2/egg\nSo, the total amount of money Janet makes daily at the farmers' market = Number of eggs sold daily x Price of each egg\n= 13", '\nStep 1:\nA robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.\n\nQuantity of blue fiber = 2 bolts\n\nStep 2:\nA robe takes half that much white fiber.\n\nQuantity of white fiber = 1/2 = 0.5 bolts\n\nStep 3:\nNow, we need to find the total number of bolts required to make a robe.\n\nTotal quantity of fiber = 2 bolts + 0.5 bolts = 2.5 bolts\n\nTherefore, it takes 2.5 bolts of fiber to make a robe.', '\nStep 1: Find the new value of the house after the repairs.\n\n$80,000 x 150% = $120,000\n\nStep 2: Find the profit made by Josh.\n\nProfit = New Value - Original Value\n= $120,000 - $80,000\n= $40,000\n\nTherefore, Josh made a profit of $40,000 on the flip of the house.', 'Step 1: How many meters does James run each sprint?\nAnswer: 60 meters\nStep 2: How many sprints does James run each week?\nAnswer: 3 sprints\nStep 3: Multiply the number of meters James runs each sprint by the number of sprints he runs each week.\nAnswer: 60 x 3 = 180 meters\nTherefore, James runs a total of 180 meters each week.', 'Step 1: Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed. So, for 20 chickens, she needs 60 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.\nStep 2: Since Wendi gives her chickens 3 cups of feed in each of the 3 meals, she needs 60 cups of feed for each meal.
