Since the bag contains 5 servings, we can divide the weight of the bag by the weight of a serving to get the number of servings:\n300g / 30g per serving = 10 servings\nStep 3: Calculate the number of calories in the remaining chips\nSince you have already consumed 1800 calories, and there are 10 servings in the bag, the number of calories in the remaining chips can be calculated as follows:\n10 servings x 250 calories per serving = 2500 calories\nSo, there", 'step 1: Calculate the total cost of supplies for 20 candles:\n$10.00 per pound of beeswax x 20 candles = $200.00\nstep 2: Calculate the total cost of supplies for 10 candles:\n$10.00 per pound of beeswax x 10 candles = $100.00\nstep 3: Calculate the net profit for 20 candles:\n$2.00 per candle x 20 candles = $40.00\nstep 4: Calculate the net profit for 10 candles:\n$2.00 per candle x 10 candles = $20.00\nFinal answer: If Charlie makes and sells 20 beeswax candles, his net profit is $40.00.

Since 30% of the wood was eaten, we need to calculate the remaining weight of the tree.\nStep 4: Carry out the plan.\nThe redwood tree is 200 feet tall, so it has 200 sections of 10 feet each.\nThe weight of each section is 400 pounds, so the total weight of the tree is:\n400 pounds/section x 200 sections = 80,000 pounds\n\nStep 5: Check your answer.\nThe final answer should be a reasonable estimate of the weight of the redwood tree based on the information provided.\n\nTherefore, the redwood tree we", 'Step 1: Determine the amount owed for each overdue book.\nNancy has 8 overdue books, each with a fine of $0.50 per book. Therefore, the total amount owed for the 8 books is:\n8 x $0.50 = $4.00\nStep 2: Determine the flat fee for having at least one book overdue for more than a week.\nThe library charges a flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book overdue for more than a week. Since Nancy has at least one book that is over a week overdue, she needs to pay this fee.\nStep 3: Add the amounts owed from steps 1 and 2 to find the total amount Nancy needs to pay.\nThe total amount Nancy needs to pay is the sum of the amounts owed for the overdue books and the flat fee:\n$4.00 (from step 1) + $2.00 (from step 2) = $6.00\nTherefore, Nancy needs to pay $6.00 to return her overdue books to the library.', 'Step 1: Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.\nStep 2: Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Jamal has 44 / 2 = 22 bananas.\nStep 3: Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 22 + 4 = 26 bananas.\nStep 4: Since Andrea has 52 apples, she must have 52 - 44 = 9 more apples than Jamal.\nStep 5: Therefore, there are 9 + 22 = 31 fruits in total.\nAnswer: There are 31 fruits in total.', '\nStep 1: Calculate the number of cookies Carla needs to bake today and tomorrow.\n\nCarla needs to bake 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so she needs to bake a total of 66 cookies.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of cups of flour needed to make one batch of cookies.\n\nTwo cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies.

Now, we can find out how many chickens are there on Farmer Brown's farm.\n\nStep 1: Let's first find out how many legs belong to the chickens.\n\nSince there are 20 chickens on the farm, each chicken has 2 legs.\n\nSo, the total number of legs belonging to the chickens is 20 x 2 = 40 legs.\n\nStep 2: Let's find out how many legs belong to the cows.\n\nSince there are 10 cows on the farm, each cow has 4 legs.\n\nSo, the total number of legs belonging to the cows is 10 x 4 = 40 legs.\n\nStep 3: Now, let's find out how many legs the animals have altogether.\n\nThe total number of legs belonging to the animals is 40 + ", "Let's break it down step by step:\nHenry and his friends ordered 7 pizzas.\nEach pizza is cut into 8 slices.\nSo, the total number of slices is 7 x 8 = 56 slices.\nIf Henry and his friends want to share the pizzas equally, they will get:\n56 slices / 4 friends = 14 slices per friend.\nTherefore, each of Henry and his 3 friends will get 14 slices of pizza."]
