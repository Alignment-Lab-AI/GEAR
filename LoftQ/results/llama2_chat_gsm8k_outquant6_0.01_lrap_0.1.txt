So, the total number of legs from insects is:\n90 x 6 = 540 legs.\n\nStep 3: Count the number of rare mutant invertebrates.\nJake sees 3 rare mutant invertebrates with 10 legs each. So, the total number of legs from rare mutant invertebrates is:\n3 x 10 = 30 legs.\n\nStep 4: Add the total number of legs from all the invertebrates.\nThe total number of legs Jake sees is:\n640 + 540 + 30 = 1230 legs.\n\nTherefore, Jake sees a total of 1230 legs in the Museum of Entomology.', "Step 1: Let's start by using the information that Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.

So, Sally Four is x/2 years old.\nStep 3: We also know that Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo. So, Sally Thirtytwo is x/2 years old.\nStep 4: Now, we can use the information that Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red to find the age of Granny Red. We can do this by subtracting 3 from the age of Sally Two: x + 3 = 3x/2.\nStep 5: Now, we can substitute the expression for Granny Red's age into the equation for Sally Four's age: x/2 = (3x/2) - 3.\nStep 6: Now, we can simplify the equation for Sally Four's age: x/2 = 2x/3 -", 'To determine how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate the total minimum payment amount for all of her debts.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.\n2. With an iron pickaxe, one dwarf can mine twice as much ore as with bare hands, so 2 x 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day.\n3. With a steel pickaxe, one dwarf can mine 50% more ore than with an iron pickaxe, so 2 x 24 = 48 pounds of ore per day.\n4. Since there are 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes, the total amount of ore they can mine per day is 40 x 48 = 192 pounds of ore per day.\n5. Since there are 30 days in a month, the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month is 192 x 30 = 5760 pounds of ore.\n\nTherefore', 'Step 1: Identify the proportional relationship between the sizes of the packages and their prices.\nIn this case, we know that the price of the first package is $3, the price of the second package is $6, and the price of the third package is unknown.\nWe can write an equation based on this information:\n$3 / 2 sandwiches = $6 / 4 sandwiches = x / 8 sandwiches\nWhere x is the price of the third package.\nStep 2: Solve the equation to find the price of the third package.\nTo solve the equation, we can divide both sides by 8, since there are 8 sandwiches in each package:\n$3 / 2 = $6 / 4 = x / 8\nx = $3 \\* 8 = $24\nSo the package with 8 sandwiches costs $24.\nTherefore, the answer is $24.', 'Step 1: Calculate the amount Tom has to pay for the bedroom set after selling his old bedroom.\nTom sold his old bedroom for $1000, so he has $2000 left to pay for the bedroom set.\nStep 2: Calculate the amount Tom has to pay each month for the bedroom set.\nTom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount each month.\n$2000 x 10% = $200\nSo Tom has to pay $200 each month for the bedroom set.\nTherefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set.', '\nStep 1: Number of balloons initially held by Sally = 25 + 7 + 12 = 44 balloons.\n\nStep 2: Number of red balloons that burst due to gust of wind = 40% of 25 = 10 balloons.\n\nStep 3: Number of yellow balloons accidentally released = 50% of 12 = 6 balloons.\n\nStep 4: Number of blue balloons found in the tree = 8 balloons.\n\nStep 5: Number of balloons finally carried into the school = Total number of balloons - Number of balloons that burst + Number of balloons accidentally released + Number of blue balloons found in the tree = 44 - 10 + 6 + 8 = 48 balloons.\n\nTherefore, Sally finally carried 48 balloons into the school.', "Step 1: Calculate the probability of Marcus having a substitute teacher tomorrow.\nThere is a 50% chance that Marcus will have a substitute teacher tomorrow.\nStep 2: Calculate the probability of Marcus's teacher giving everyone an extension even if the normal teacher comes in.\nThere is a 40% chance that Marcus's teacher will give everyone an extension even if the normal teacher comes in.\nStep 3: Calculate the probability of Marcus convincing his teacher that his dog ate his assignment and getting a personal extension.\nThere is a 20% chance that Marcus will be able to convince his teacher that his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.\nStep 4: Calculate the final probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework tomorrow.\nTo find the final probability, we multiply the probabilities from each step:\n50% x 40% x 20% = 40%\nTherefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 40%.", 'Step 1: Calculate the total number of available seats.\n\nTotal available seats = 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750\n\nStep 2: Divide the total number of available seats by the total number of graduates.\n\nTotal number of tickets per graduate = 4750 / 95 = 50\n\nStep 3: Since each graduate will receive 50 tickets, how many tickets will each graduate be able to give to their friends and family?\n\nEach graduate can give 50 tickets x 5 = 250 tickets to their friends and family.']

In 3 years, he will be 6 years old.", '\nStep 1:\nAna spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.\nJane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.\n\nStep 2:\nAna has peeled 3 oranges in 3 minutes.\nJane has peeled 4 oranges in 4 minutes.\n\nStep 3:\nAna has peeled 3 oranges in 3 minutes = 3 oranges peeled by Ana in 1 minute.\nJane has peeled 4 oranges in 4 minutes = 1 orange peeled by Jane in 1 minute.\n\nStep 4:\nIf Ana and Jane start picking oranges from the basket at the same time and Ana has peeled 3 oranges in 1 minute, then Jane has peeled 1 orange in 1 minute.\n\nStep 5:\nIf they both continue peeling oranges at the same rate for an hour, then Ana will have peeled 3 x 60 = 180 oranges in an hour.\nJane will have peeled 1 x 60 = 60 oranges in an hour', '\nStep 1: Calculate the cost of the radiator from the regular store\n$400\n\nStep 2: Calculate the cost of the radiator from the junk shop\n$400 x 0.8 = $320\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total cost of the installation\n$320 + (3 hours x $50) = $400\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total cost of the new radiator and installation\n$400 + $400 = $800\n\nTherefore, Mark paid $800 for the new radiator and installation.', "\n1. How many legs do chickens have?\n\nChickens have 4 legs.\n\n2. How many legs do cows have?\n\nCows have 4 legs.\n\n3. How many legs do all the animals on Farmer Brown's farm have in total?\n\nAll the animals on Farmer Brown's farm have a total of 70 legs.\n\n4. How many of the animals on Farmer Brown's farm are chickens?\n\nSince chickens have 4 legs, and cows have 4 legs, the total number of legs of all the animals on Farmer Brown's farm is 70 legs. Since chickens have 4 legs, the number of chickens on the farm is 70/4 = 17. So, there are 17 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.", 'Step 1: Calculate the total number of slices needed for 4 people.\nTotal number of slices needed = Number of pizzas x Number of slices per pizza\nTotal number of slices needed = 7 x 8\nTotal number of slices needed = 56\n\nStep 2: Divide the total number of slices needed by the number of people sharing the pizzas.\nNumber of slices per person = Total number of slices needed / Number of people sharing pizzas\nNumber of slices per person = 56 / 4\nNumber of slices per person = 14\n\nTherefore, each of Henry and his 3 friends can have 14 slices of pizza.']
