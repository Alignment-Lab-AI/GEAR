To calculate the total cost of making one jar, we need to multiply the cost of each ingredient by the amount used: $6 x 2 pounds = $12 for passion fruit, $8 x 1.5 pounds = $12 for jackfruit, and $10 x 2 pounds = $20 for honey.\n6. Now we subtract the total cost from the selling price to find the profit: $50 - ($12 + $12 + $20) = $26 per jar.\n7.
