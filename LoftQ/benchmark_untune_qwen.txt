The total number of kittens adopted is 12 kittens + 7 kittens = 19 kittens.\nSince Patchy and Trixie are the only cats to have had kittens, the Doubtfire sisters' mother says that the two cats have had a total of 21 kittens + 12 kittens = 33 kittens.\nTherefore, the answer is 33.", 'First, we need to find out how many lollipops Jean has after eating 2 of them. For that we do 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops.\nThen we divide the number of lollipops Jean has by the number of lollipops she puts in a bag. So we do 28 / 2 = 14 bags.']
