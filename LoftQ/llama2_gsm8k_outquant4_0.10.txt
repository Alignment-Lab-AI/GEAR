So, in this case, you can eat 50 calories per serving of chips.\nStep 2: Calculate how many servings you can eat based on your daily calorie target. If your daily calorie target is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories, that means you have 200 calories left to eat. Divide this number by the number of calories you can eat in one serving of chips (50), and you get the number of servings you can eat. In this case, you can eat 4 servings of chips (200 / 50 = 4).\nStep 3: Multiply the number of servings you can eat by the number of grams in a serving of chips to find out how many grams you can eat. In this case, if you can eat 4 servings of chips, and each serving contains 5', "\nStep 1: Determine the total cost of supplies for 20 candles.\n$10.00 per pound of beeswax x 20 candles = $200.00\n\nStep 2: Determine the total cost of the wicks for 20 candles.\n$0.20 per wick x 20 candles = $4.00\n\nStep 3: Determine the total cost of making and selling 20 candles.\n$200.00 + $4.00 = $204.00\n\nStep 4: Determine the net profit for selling 20 candles.\n$204.00 - $20.00 (the amount Charlie paid for the beeswax) = $184.00\n\nAnswer: Charlie's net profit for selling 20 candles is $184.00.", 'Step 1: Calculate the number of articles written on Monday and Tuesday.\nMeredith wrote 5 articles on Monday and 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday, so she wrote 3 articles on Tuesday.\nTotal number of articles written on Monday and Tuesday = 5 + 3 = 8 articles.\nStep 2: Calculate the number of articles written on Wednesday.\nMeredith wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, so she wrote 6 articles on Wednesday.\nTotal number of articles written on Wednesday = 6 articles.\nStep 3: Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles in the three days.\nFor each article, Meredith spends 4 hours researching and writing.\nTotal number of hours spent writing articles on Monday and Tuesday = 8 articles x 4 hours/article = 32 hours.\nTotal number of hours spent writing articles on Wednesday = 6 articles x 4 hours/article = 24 hours.\nStep 4: Add the total number of hours spent writing articles on each day to find the total number of hours spent', '\nStep 1: 80 (initial notes in purse) - 23 (remaining notes) = 57\n\nStep 2: 57 / 20 (number of cups of coffee) = 2.85\n\nStep 3: Since you cannot have a fraction of a note, round up to the nearest whole number: 3\n\nTherefore, the package of Post-it notes that Candice purchased contained 3 notes.', 'Step 1: John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.\nSo, if he buys x blue ties, he buys 2x red ties.\nStep 2: The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties.\nSo, the cost of one red tie is 50% more than the cost of one blue tie.\nStep 3: John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each.\nSo, the total cost of the blue ties is $200 x $40 = $8000.\nStep 4: Now, we can find the total cost of all the ties by adding the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties.\nTotal cost = Cost of blue ties + Cost of red ties\nTotal cost = $8000 + (2x $40)\nTotal cost = $8000 + $800\nTotal cost = $8800\n\nTherefore, John spent $8800 on ties.']
