Since yellow cards are as many as the sum of red and green cards, the number of yellow cards = x + (2x \\* 1.6) = 3x.\n\nNow, answer the final number:\n\nThere are 15 red cards, so the number of red cards is x = 15.\n\nSince 60% more green cards, the number of green cards is 15 \\* 1.6 = 24.\n\nThe total number of cards is 2x = 30.\n\nAnd, the number of yellow cards is 3x = 45.\n\nSo, there are 15 red cards, 24 green cards, and 45 yellow cards in the set of magicians' cards.", 'Step 1: 50 fairies were initially seen.\nStep 2: 30 fairies flew away.\nStep 3: 20 fairies remained (50 - 30 = 20).\nTherefore, 20 fairies are remaining.', "Step 1: Find the total number of puppies.\nJennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, so the total number of puppies is:\n8 + 12 = 20\nStep 2: Find the number of puppies with spots for each dog.\nJennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots, so the total number of puppies with spots is:\n3 + 4 = 7\nStep 3: Find the percentage of puppies with spots.\nTo find the percentage of puppies with spots, divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies:\n7/20 = 0.35 or 35%\nSo, 35% of all the puppies have spots.", 'Step 1: Calculate the total weight of feed required by the farmer.\nTotal weight of hay = 42 x 75 = 3100 pounds\nTotal weight of carrots = 4 x 12 = 48 pounds\nTotal weight of sugar cubes = 2 x 1 = 2 pounds\nTotal weight of oats = 20 x 65 = 1300 pounds\nTotal weight of feed = 3100 + 48 + 2 + 1300 = 2080 pounds\nStep 2: Calculate the number of trips the farmer needs to make to transport all the feed.\nSince the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, the farmer needs to make the following number of trips:\n2080 pounds / 2250 pounds per trip = 0.90 trips\nSo the farmer needs to make 0.90 trips to transport all the feed.', 'Step 1: Calculate the number of aluminum cans Grayson drinks in a week.\nGrayson drinks three aluminum cans of soda per week.\nStep 2: Calculate the number of plastic bottles Grayson drinks in a week.\nGrayson drinks five plastic bottles of water per week.\nStep 3: Calculate the total number of cans and bottles Grayson recycles in a week.\nGrayson recycles 3 aluminum cans and 5 plastic bottles per week.\nStep 4: Calculate the total number of cents Grayson earns from recycling in a week.\nGrayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and 3 cents for each plastic bottle.

Now, we need to subtract the number of burritos consumed from the total number of burritos ordered to find the number of leftover burritos.\n\nLeftover burritos = Total number of burritos ordered - Number of burritos consumed\n= 600 - 500\n= 100 burritos\n\nTherefore, there were", '\n1.
