["Let the number of days in a week be 'n'.\nJanet lays 16 eggs per day. So, the total number of eggs she lays in a week is 16 x 7 = 112 eggs.\nShe eats 3 eggs for breakfast every day. So, the total number of eggs she eats in a week is 3 x 7 = 21 eggs.\nShe bakes muffins for her friends every day using 4 eggs. So, the total number of muffins she bakes in a week is 4 x 7 = 28 muffins.\nShe sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market. Let the number of eggs she sells in a week be 'x'.\nThe price of each egg at the farmers' market is $2. So, the total amount of money Janet makes from selling eggs at the farmers' market in a week is $2 x x = 2x dollars.\nNow, we need to find out how much money Janet makes every day at the farmers' market.

If a 300g bag has 5 servings, how many grams can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories?\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Calculate the number of calories in 1 serving of chips:\n\n250 calories / 5 servings = 50 calories per serving\n2. Calculate the number of grams of chips you can eat based on your daily calorie target:\n\n2000 calories / 50 calories per serving = 40 grams of chips\n3.
